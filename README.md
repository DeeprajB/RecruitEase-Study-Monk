        Homepage: Create an engaging landing page that showcases the key features and benefits of the online recruitment solution, emphasizing its efficiency for hiring managers and HR professionals.
    </li>
    <li>
        User Login and Register Pages: Develop secure login and registration pages specifically tailored for companies. This will enable them to access the recruitment solution and utilize its features effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Candidate Search: Implement a search functionality that allows users to find candidates based on location and job roles. Additionally, design a section where the fetched candidates can be listed for later ranking and evaluation.
    </li>
</ol>
